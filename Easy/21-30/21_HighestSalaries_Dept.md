## ðŸ’» SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    ABS(
        MAX(CASE WHEN d.department = 'marketing' THEN e.salary ELSE NULL END) -
        MAX(CASE WHEN d.department = 'engineering' THEN e.salary ELSE NULL END)
    ) AS absolute_salary_difference
FROM db_employee e
JOIN db_dept d ON e.department_id = d.id;
