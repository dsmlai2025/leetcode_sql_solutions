**Explanation:**
Counting Products per Year: Using SUM with CASE statements, we count the number of products launched in 2020 and 2019 separately for each company. 
Calculating Net Difference: We calculate the difference between 2020 and 2019 product counts to get the net change. 
Ordering: The results are ordered by net_difference in descending order to show companies with the highest increase first.
