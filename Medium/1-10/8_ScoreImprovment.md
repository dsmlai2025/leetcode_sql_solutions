# Problem 8 - Score Improvement

## ðŸ“„ Problem Statement
Write a solution to find employees who have consistently improved their performance over their last three reviews.
An employee must have at least 3 review to be considered
The employee's last 3 reviews must show strictly increasing ratings (each review better than the previous)
Use the most recent 3 reviews based on review_date for each employee
Calculate the improvement score as the difference between the latest rating and the earliest rating among the last 3 reviews
Return the result table ordered by improvement score in descending order, then by name in ascending order.Â
