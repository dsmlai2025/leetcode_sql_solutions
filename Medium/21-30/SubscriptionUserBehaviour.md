# Problem 21 - Subscription User Behaviour

## ðŸ“„ Problem Statement
A subscription service wants to analyze user behavior patterns. The company offers a 7-day free trial, after which users can subscribe to a paid plan or cancel. Write a solution to:
Find users who converted from free trial to paid subscription
Calculate each user's average daily activity duration during their free trial period (rounded to 2 decimal places)
Calculate each user's average daily activity duration during their paid subscription period (rounded to 2 decimal places). Return the result table ordered by user_id in ascending order.

**Table:** 

UserActivity table:

## ðŸ§ª Example

**Output**
| user_id | trial_avg_duration | paid_avg_duration |

## ðŸ’¡ Approach


## ðŸ’» SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT user_id,
ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'free_trial' THEN activity_duration END), 2) AS trial_avg_duration,
ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'paid' THEN activity_duration END), 2) AS paid_avg_duration
FROM UserActivity
WHERE activity_type IN ('free_trial', 'paid')
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity_type) = 2
