# Problem 28 - Product Recommendations

## ðŸ“„ Problem Statement
Amazon wants to implement the Customers who bought this also bought... feature based on co-purchase patterns. Write a solution to :
Identify distinct product pairs frequently purchased together by the same customers (where product1_id < product2_id)
For each product pair, determine how many customers purchased both products
A product pair is considered for recommendation if at least 3 different customers have purchased both products.
Return the result table ordered by customer_count in descending order, and in case of a tie, by product1_id in ascending order, and then by product2_id in ascending order.Â
