Return the result tableÂ ordered by student_id, subject in ascending order.Â 

**Table:** 

Scores table:
| student_id | subject  | score | exam_date  |
|------------|----------|-------|------------|
| 101        | Math     | 70    | 2023-01-15 |
| 101        | Math     | 85    | 2023-02-15 |
| 101        | Physics  | 65    | 2023-01-15 |
| 101        | Physics  | 60    | 2023-02-15 |
| 102        | Math     | 80    | 2023-01-15 |
| 102        | Math     | 85    | 2023-02-15 |
| 103        | Math     | 90    | 2023-01-15 |

## ðŸ§ª Example

**Output**
| student_id | subject  | first_score | latest_score |
|------------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| 101        | Math     | 70          | 85           |
| 102        | Math     | 80          | 85           |

## ðŸ’¡ Approach


## ðŸ’» SQL Solution

```sql
select student_id, subject, min_scr as first_score, max_scr as latest_score from
(select student_id, subject, score, exam_date,
FIRST_VALUE(score) OVER(PARTITION BY student_id, subject ORDER BY exam_date asc) as min_scr,
LAST_VALUE(score) OVER(PARTITION BY student_id, subject ORDER BY exam_date asc) as max_scr,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY student_id, subject ORDER BY exam_date desc) as rn
from Scores) as t
where rn =1 and min_scr < max_scr
