# Problem 15 - Meeting Heavy Employees


## ðŸ“„ Problem Statement
Write a solution to find employees who are meeting-heavy - employees who spend more than 50% of their working time in meetings during any given week.
Assume a standard work week is 40 hours
Calculate total meeting hours per employee per week (Monday to Sunday)
An employee is meeting-heavy if their weekly meeting hours > 20 hours (50% of 40 hours)
Count how many weeks each employee was meeting-heavy
Only include employees who were meeting-heavy for at least 2 weeks
Return the result table ordered by the number of meeting-heavy weeks in descending order, then by employee name in ascending order.Â
