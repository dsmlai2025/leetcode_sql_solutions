```sql
WITH DailySales AS (
    SELECT
    visited_on, SUM(amount) AS amount
    FROM Customer
    GROUP BY visited_on
),
RankedDays AS (
  SELECT 
    visited_on,
    amount,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY visited_on) AS rn,
    SUM(amount) OVER (
      ORDER BY visited_on
      ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS sum_amount,
    ROUND(AVG(amount) OVER (
      ORDER BY visited_on
      ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ), 2) AS average_amount
  FROM DailySales
)
SELECT 
  visited_on,
  sum_amount AS amount,
